Gradio represents a Python library that expeditiously enables the creation of adaptable UI (User Interface) components for your machine learning models, neural networks, and other functionalities. By utilizing Gradio, generating a web app or desktop app for your machine learning model becomes a straightforward task. It emerges as a valuable asset for data scientists and machine learning engineers seeking swift model building, testing, and deployment capabilities.

Weâ€™re set to build a customer churn prediction application using Gradio. Our approach involves employing customer data sourced from a telecommunications company to train a machine learning model. Subsequently, we will craft a Gradio application that ingests customer data and produces predictions regarding their likelihood of churning.
